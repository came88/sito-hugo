I'm Lorenzo Cameroni, and I'm a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

At work I mostly write code in Java, but I use many language and tools, such as:

- Java, Maven, Spring and Spring Boot
- SQL and PL/SQL
- MongoDB
- Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift
- Bash and Powershell
- Javascript
- HTML and CSS
- XML and sometimes XSLT, XPath
- GIT
