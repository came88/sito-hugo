I'm Lorenzo Cameroni, and I'm a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in Maths.

At work I mostly write code in Java, but I use many language and tools, such as:

- Java, Maven, Spring and Spring Boot
- SQL and PL/SQL
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Bash
- Powershell
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- XML and sometimes XSL
